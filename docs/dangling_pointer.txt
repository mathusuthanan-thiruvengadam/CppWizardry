A pointer pointing to a memory location that has been deleted (or freed) is called a dangling pointer. Such a situation can lead to unexpected behavior in the program and also serve as a source of bugs in C programs.

3 ways this situation occurs
1) Deallocation of memory but not resetting the pointer to NULL
2) Returning address of a stack variable from a function (It makes no sense after exiting from the function)
