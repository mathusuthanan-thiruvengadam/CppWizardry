Lists are sequence containers that allow non-contiguous memory allocation. As compared to the vector, the list has slow traversal, but once a position has been found, insertion and deletion are quick (constant time). Normally, when we say a List, we talk about a doubly linked list. For implementing a singly linked list, we use a forward_list.

	std::list <data-type> name_of_list;
