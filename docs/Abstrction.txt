Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important features of object-oriented programming in C++. Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details. Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation. 

Types of Abstraction:
	Data abstraction – This type only shows the required information about the data and hides the unnecessary data.
	Control Abstraction – This type only shows the required information about the implementation and hides unnecessary information.

Advantages of Data Abstraction
	Helps the user to avoid writing the low-level code
	Avoids code duplication and increases reusability.
	Can change the internal implementation of the class independently without affecting the user.
	Helps to increase the security of an application or program as only important details are provided to the user.
	It reduces the complexity as well as the redundancy of the code, therefore increasing the readability.
