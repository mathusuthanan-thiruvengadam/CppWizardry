 Resource Acquisition Is Initialization programming idiom. 
 The main goal of this idiom is to ensure that resource acquisition occurs at the same time that the object is initialized, so that all resources for the object are created and made ready in one line of code. 
 In practical terms, the main principle of RAII is to give ownership 
	 [of any heap-allocated resource—for example, dynamically-allocated memory or system object handles—]
	 to 
	 [a stack-allocated object whose destructor contains the code to delete or free the resource and also any associated cleanup code].
