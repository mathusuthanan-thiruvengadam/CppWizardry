In C++, a class can inherit from multiple classes which is commonly referred as multiple inheritance. But this can cause problems sometimes, as you can have multiple instances of the base class.

To tackle this problem, C++ uses a technique which ensures only one instance of a base class is present. That technique is referred as virtual inheritance.

Virtual inheritance is used to solve 
	Diamond problem
	To avoid calling baseclass constructor
