default constructor: 
=====================
A default constructor is a constructor that either has no parameters, or if it has parameters, all the parameters have default values.

The compiler first implicitly defines the implicitly declared constructors of the base classes and nonstatic data members of a class A before defining the implicitly declared constructor of A. 

No default constructor is created for a class that has any constant or reference type members. This behavior is due to the fact that constant and reference members must be initialized upon object creation, and the default constructor generated by the compiler does not provide a way to initialize them.

No default constructor is created for a class that has other constructors. (inferred)

q:reason? As developer is specific about how to create an object when a constructor is defined explicitly, default constructor is not provided.



Copy constructure
=================
A copy constructor for a class A is a constructor whose first parameter is of type A&, const A&, volatile A&, or const volatile A&. 

Copy constructors are used to make a copy of one class object from another class object of the same class type. 

You cannot use a copy constructor with an argument of the same type as its class; you must use a reference. If you attempt to define a copy constructor that takes an argument of the same type as its class, it would lead to an infinite loop or stack overflow situation. 

If we do not define a copy constructor, the compiler will generate one for us that performs a shallow copy (copies only a pointer so that the two pointers refer to the same object) of the existing object's member variables. 

q:in which scenario we will define our own copy constructor?, when we need deep copy as the default implementation uses shallow copy?
